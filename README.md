Work split draft:

Nolan:
    Main character animations
    Main character movement and interaction
    NPC animations? 

Kelsey:
    Inventory functionality & UI
    Educational portion functionality & UI (adding value to total)
    Beginning and end screens UI

Drew:
    Map terrain / structures
    Collectible items on the map
    NPC functionality (AI? Interact with main character?)


Left to do until Minimum Viable Product:
- Set current fruits to Kelsey's new fruits
- Game win screen
- Game over screen? (It currently just goes back to start screen which should be fine)
- Create exit to the game in the world (Like a portal that you jump in and ends the game and counts your score)
- Character skins/animations
